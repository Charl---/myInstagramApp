  <p dir="ltr">Age restricted access : no persons under the age of eighteen (18) years, twenty-one (21) years in places where eighteen (18) years is not the age of majority, may directly or indirectly view, possess or otherwise use the BREAK Services.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p dir="ltr">Affirmation of current adult status. You hereby affirm and warrant that you are currently over the age of eighteen (18) years, twenty-one (21) years in places where eighteen (18) years is not the age of majority, and you are capable of lawfully entering into and performing all the obligations set forth in this agreement.</p>

BREAK reserves the right to perform criminal background screenings to confirm Your compliance with these terms.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p dir="ltr">1.3 By having a membership account with the BREAK Service, You acknowledge that You meet our requirements for membership. As a Member, You may not have more than one membership account, nor may You open an alternative account if Your membership is suspended, restricted or terminated for any reason. You may not share, sell, trade or transfer a membership account to another person. If an account violates these conditions, the account will be terminated immediately.</p>
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;
  <p dir="ltr">1.6 As a member of BREAK, You warrant that You are using the mobile application as a private individual for private use, and not on behalf of or representing any form of a commercial entity, corporation or other business organization.

  &nbsp;
  <p dir="ltr">2. Determining and Sharing Location</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p dir="ltr">2.1 BREAK deals with location, so in order to work, BREAK needs to know your location. Whenever you open and use/interact with the BREAK app on your mobile device or go to Break.fm, we use the location information from your mobile device or browser (e.g., latitude and longitude) to tailor the BREAK experience to your current location (i.e., we’ll show you a list of nearby locations, friends and tips). This information is NOT shared with others. Also, BREAK uses your mobile device’s ‘background location’ (formerly known as ‘Radar’) to provide the service, including to send you notifications of tips/friends/ interesting things etc. near you. If you have ‘background location’ turned on, the BREAK app will, from time to time, tell us about your device’s location even if you are not directly interacting with the application.</p>
  &nbsp;
  <p dir="ltr">2.2 Your location data is ONLY shared with others when you proactively decide to "check in" to tell BREAK you’re at a particular place or, if you have turned on ‘check-in by friends,’ when your friend mentions you in his or her check in. The location information shared with a "check in" is the location information of that place. Each of your BREAK check-ins is saved to your "Check-in History," which allows you to look back at all the locations you have checked in since you created your BREAK account. You can delete any or all of your check-ins from the check-in details page on the BREAK app. If for some reason you ever decide to delete your BREAK account, your entire check-in history will be removed from our database.</p>
  &nbsp;
